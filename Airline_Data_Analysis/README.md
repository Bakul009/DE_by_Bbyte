✈️ Airline Flight Data Analysis with Python
📌 Overview

This project is a practice data analysis exercise on an Airline Flights Dataset using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
The goal was to revisit core Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) skills, perform data cleaning, and answer key business-oriented questions about flight prices, timings, airlines, and passenger choices.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: DataBricks Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains flight details such as:

Airline

Source City & Destination City

Departure Time & Arrival Time

Class (Economy / Business)

Price

Days Left (days before departure the ticket was booked)

Duration

🎯 Business Questions Answered

1. The analysis is structured around the following questions:

2. What are the airlines in the dataset, accompanied by their frequencies?

3. Show Bar Graphs representing the Departure Time & Arrival Time.

4. Show Bar Graphs representing the Source City & Destination City.

5. Does price vary with airlines?

6. Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?

7.  How does the price change with change in Source and Destination?

8. How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?

9. How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?

10. What will be the Average Price of Vistara airline for a flight from Delhi to Hyderabad in Business Class?

📊 Key Visualizations
