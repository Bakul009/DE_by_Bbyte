# 📂 Data Engineering Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Projects** repository! 🚀

This repo is a growing collection of **end-to-end data engineering projects** where I experiment, build, and share different architectures, pipelines, and workflows using modern data tools and platforms. The goal of this repository is to **document my learning journey** and provide **practical implementations** that can help others explore the field of Data Engineering.

---

## 🔎 Repository Overview

In this repository, you will find:

* **Cloud-based Data Pipelines** – Projects using AWS, Azure, or GCP.
* **Batch & Streaming Data Processing** – ETL/ELT workflows with Spark, Kafka, Databricks, etc.
* **Data Warehousing & Lakehouse Architectures** – Snowflake, Delta Lake, Redshift, BigQuery.
* **Orchestration & Scheduling** – Airflow, Databricks Workflows, Cloud Schedulers.
* **Visualization & Analytics** – Dashboards in Databricks, Power BI, or other BI tools.

Each project folder will include:

* 📘 **README** explaining the project’s purpose, architecture, and steps.
* 🏗️ **Infrastructure setup** (where applicable).
* 📜 **Code scripts/notebooks**.
* 📊 **Sample dashboards or outputs**.
